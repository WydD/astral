[Archived] Astral - Java-OSGi Data Stream Management Engine

Advanced Stream Algebra is an algebra designed to provide a complete theory on data treatment over streams, relations and historics. This theory inherits from the Relational Algebra. This engine implements all the concept provided by this algebra in a Java-OSGi prototype.

Main features are: 
* Clean and unambigious language 
* Support of all generic operators (joins, windows, streamers, relational operations) 
* Generic and evolutive query plan optimization 
* Simple integration of new sources/handlers 
* Highly customizable service oriented architecture (add operators, user functions, tools, optimization rules) .
* Administration tools 
* Deployable on any Java-OSGi environment (with iPojo bundle)

This project is lead by the SIGMA team from the Grenoble Informatics Laboratory.
