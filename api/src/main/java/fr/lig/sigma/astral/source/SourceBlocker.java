/**
 * Utility class that helps developers to build sources which have unknown arrivals.
 *
 * This class is an event processor that is placed inside the scheduling pipeline in order to wait for a new arrival.
 * The usage is fairly simple. Once created with an attached source, the source implementation must signal this object
 * to release the lock.
 *
 * In order to keep the global coherency, the <pre>waitFor</pre> function for the source MUST include this processor.
 *
 * Also, the <pre>firstSchedule</pre> must be called to initialize the process as well as a source
